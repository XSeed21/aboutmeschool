			<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Childhood Years</u></h2>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, I 
			was like everybody else.<sup>1</sup> A child running, and playing around the streets without a care 
			in the world.<sup>2</sup> Those were certainly my most liveliest years.<sup>3</sup>
			I am the first child of our family, born and lived my earliest years in Barangka, 
			Marikina City.<sup>4</sup> We had lived there for about five years as much as I can 
			remember.<sup>5</sup> Not only us but my grandparents, my uncles, and aunts on my father's 
			side was there as well, though we lived in different houses.<sup>6</sup> As a child I often 
			go out to playwith my cousins and friends back there.<sup>7</sup> Sometimes we play on the 
			streets, other times we play on the <strong>local arcade</strong>.<sup>8</sup></p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Life has been the same until we move out on the year 2006.<sup>1</sup> From the noisy urban 
			streets of Barangka, we moved to the quiet subdivision of Sta Barbara 2 that I am still
			living at until today.<sup>2</sup> It was also at this year that I began my education at 
			pre-school in a nearby small school for nursery to preparatory students.<sup>3</sup> I ended 
			my preschool years with a Bronze medal on my graduation day.<sup>4</sup></p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that 
			comes the rest of my childhood days.<sup>1</sup> I enrolled in a school called Infant Jesus 
			Academy.<sup>2</sup> It is here where I spent the majority of my school life.<sup>3</sup> 
			It was one of my life's turning point as compared to my preschool where there were more or 
			less only 20 students, my new school has about double of that, in one classroom.<sup>4</sup> 
			Not to mention that we are only one class out of 4 or 5 in one level, and 13 levels 
			overall.<sup>5</sup> Throughout these years, I pretty much maintained status as an <strong>honor 
			student</strong>, but not good enough to compete with the gold, silver, and bronze 
			medals, though I almost managed to do it one time.<sup>6</sup></p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also around 
			this time that I started getting very fond of <strong>video games</strong>.<sup>1</sup> I got <strong>my playstation 
			2</strong> while I was at my 2nd grade, and from then on the amount of times that I went out to play 
			has decreased.<sup>2</sup> I would spend most of my time playing in the confort of my own 
			room, a controller in hand.<sup>3</sup> Sometimes my friends at that time would come over to 
			play, sometime I would invite them over.<sup>4</sup> However, as a child I would get a 
			limited amount of time to play, only being able to do so during weekends.<sup>5</sup> When I 
			can't play my console, that is when I go outside to play just like any other kids.<sup>6</sup>
			
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things 
			changed however when we moved once again.<sup>1</sup> However, unlike last time, we didn't move very 
			far, in fact just within our subdivision.<sup>2</sup> The friends I used to know aren't that 
			far away but the distance was already too much for me to join them playing everyday.<sup>3</sup> 
			The neighbors in my new area aren't that close to my age either so I really don't have any 
			people to play with.<sup>4</sup> Ever since we moved to our new location, I've spent almost 
			all of my time <strong>playing indoors</strong>, and that routine has continued until now.<sup>5</sup></p>

			<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Teenage Years</u></h2>
			
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
			can say that my teenage years has officially started soon as I reached high school.<sup>1</sup> 
			Things were a lot more difficult than it has ever been, and I've gained a new perspective on 
			life.<sup>2</sup> At this time, the classmates I knew during my grade school days have went 
			to different schools, most of them at least.<sup>3</sup> Which means that when the new school 
			year started, there were a lot of new students that I'm to get familiar with.<sup>4</sup> The 
			population of new students to old students in my class was so high that the number of people 
			I knew back then can be counted with my two hands.<sup>5</sup> It was also at this stage 
			that I transitioned from a <strong>noisy kid</strong> who talks whenever he wants, to a <strong>reserved teenage boy</strong> 
			who barely interacted with the people around him.<sup>6</sup> During these years, I would 
			mostly spend my breaktimes, apart from eating, in the <strong>library</strong>.<sup>7</sup> I went there to 
			avoid the noisy cafeteria, reading random books.<sup>8</sup> I wasn't even there to study, 
			or learn something new. I just read whatever book I get my hands on.<sup>9</sup></p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
			had quite an uneventful early highschool years.<sup>1</sup> The only thing I can say that 
			seems eventful for me back then was that everytime there's a </strong>Math, and Science Quiz Bee</strong>, 
			I would participate and get the top place.<sup>2</sup> That is, until 10th grade where I was 
			dethroned from my consecutive victories in the </strong>Science Quiz Bee</strong>.<sup>3</sup> 
			Speaking of 10th grade, it was also what I remember as the most eventful year of my high school 
			life in that school.<sup>4</sup> The ones I remember the most is when I was chosen to participate
			in an inter school <strong>Math Quiz Bee</strong>, two in fact.<sup>5</sup> One of them was the 
			well known <strong>MTAP</strong> which I participated with other people from my class.<sup>6</sup> 
			We managed to get past the city division but failed to get past the next round.<sup>7</sup> 
			The other was the <strong>Pithagoras</strong> which was held in University of Sto. Thomas.<sup>8</sup> 
			I remember back then that it was the first time that I got to set foot in such a massive 
			campus.<sup>9</sup> The results of the <strong>Math Quiz Bee</strong> however was not to be 
			talked about, but I had fun during the tutoring sessions from teachers of our school.<sup>10</sup></p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
			only stayed at that school until grade 10, then when Senior High came, I transferred.<sup>1</sup>
			I applied into 3 schools but in the end, I got into the Polytechnic University of the 
			Philippines.<sup>2</sup> It was here where my highschool life felt the liveliest, and it was 
			also here where I met the group of friends that I would consider as the ones that influenced,
			and I grew close to the most.<sup>3</sup> My time here may have been the shortest but it 
			was the biggest I've grew so far.<sup>4</sup> At this time, it was the biggest culture shock 
			for me, my school is not the closeby-type anymore, it was out, way out into the capital.<sup>5</sup> 
			The enormous population my previous school had was nothing to what I had seen in my new 
			school.<sup>6</sup> The trip was also pretty far, taking me about two hours of commute just 
			to get there.<sup>7</sup> It was the most freedom that I felt as a young teenager.<sup>8</sup></p>

			<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>College Years</u></h2>
			
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			College might have been the most challenging series of events I had so far.<sup>1</sup> The 
			first hurdle actually started during my late grade 12 days.<sup>2</sup> It was at this time 
			that my college hunting started, after all I had to decide on which institution to go 
			into.<sup>3</sup> My first application was my entrance exam in University of the East.<sup>4</sup> 
			I applied for the <strong>BSEMC-Digital Animation</strong> program, which thankfully I managed to 
			pass.<sup>5</sup> The next I applied and taken the test was iAcademy, this was originally my 
			initial choice, and I managed to pass with ease but my parents couldn't sustain the extremely
			high tuition fee per semester, and with a trimester per year at that so I couldn't enroll.<sup>6</sup>
			Then I applied, and took the test at the  University of the Philippines.<sup>7</sup> Sadly, 
			I didn't my scores didn't make it for admission, though they made it for reconsideration
			but the courses I can take with it was the courses I merely put for the sake of filling up 
			the form.<sup>8</sup> So in the end, my college destination was University of the East.<sup>9</sup>
			In addition to that, I was selected to take the <strong>UE Tan Yan Kee scholarship</strong>, which I passed 
			as well, but for the cost of selecting a program that the scholarship covers, and that is 
			why I currently am in the <strong>Computer Science</strong> program instead.<sup>10</sup> Thanks to this, up 
			until now, I am able to enjoy a cost-free college in exchange for not getting the exact 
			course I was aiming for.<sup>11</sup></p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			However, the hunt didn't end there.<sup>1</sup> During the transition time between grade 12 
			and college, I applied for a scholarship abroad, in Japan called <strong>MEXT</strong>.<sup>2</sup> It was a 
			huge opportunity as it was my dream to go to Japan because of my obsession to <strong>anime</strong>, and 
			<strong>Japan's</strong> culture in general.<sup>3</sup> I applied for an <strong>animation</strong> course, and the exam is 
			scheduled in a few months.<sup>4</sup> Therefore while I am taking my 1st semester studies, 
			at the same time, I was also studying for my Japan scholarship.<sup>5</sup> Fast forward to 
			the exam date, I was able to take it with a few friends who applied with me.<sup>6</sup> The 
			test however, may have been the most difficult test I took so far, even more difficult than
			the test I took in the UPCAT.<sup>7</sup> Sadly, I didn't get the scholarship and thus I 
			continued through with my college life in UE, though the journey does not end there.<sup>8</sup> 
			Since that scholarship can be applied for no matter what year level I am, I strived to take 
			it again the following year, at least I planned to until the <strong>CoVid19</strong> pandemic started and a 
			community quarantine was implemented.<sup>9</sup> I wasn't able to take it again up until 
			now due to my location being quite far to travel to and from the site.<sup>10</sup>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The <strong>CoVid19</strong> pandemic has been a big liability to me, and to us in general.<sup>1</sup> I'm 
			not really an outside person so the quarantine lifestyle is no stranger to me, however
			it did prevent me from going out and playing at the arcades like I used to after class during
			the face-to-face sessions.<sup>2</sup> I never thought I'd long to go outside even though 
			I'm an inside person.<sup>3</sup> The quarantine days passed by, quite quickly in fact that 
			I didn't even notice how fast it went.<sup>4</sup> It was time for enrollment for the 2nd
			year sooner than I thought, though it got delayed from June to August.<sup>5</sup> I 
			enrolled quite easily since it's online, and I don't have to pay for anything thanks to 
			my scholarship.<sup>6</sup> The quarantined-online school life continued until today.<sup>7</sup> 
			I don't know how long it will last, but I hope that I'll be able to go out and do what i wanted
			to do again, enjoying the freedom I used to have.<sup>8</sup></p>
